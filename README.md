# Datastructures & Algorithms

## Introduction

Created a Repository for learning DSA Concepts and Solutions. I will be updating problems and solutions as i solve them on various platforms. 
The primary purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and the problems that i come across. However, As I progress, I will also be explaining various concepts and how i solve them bby explaining. 

You can find different folders and each one will have its own README.md file explaining the concept. Besides, I have also been learning from various sources including Linkedin Learning, Youtube and write any notes explaining the concepts for which i will be updating references and update the README.md file accordingly.


## Problem Solving Approach
### STEP 1: STATE THE PROBLEM CLEARLY

### STEP 2: IDENTIFY INPUTS & OUTPUTS, Funtion Signature  

### STEP 3: CREATE TEST CASES & LIST EDGE CASES

### STEP 4: SOLUTION IN PLAIN ENGLISH

### STEP 5: IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION (CAN BE BRUTE FORCE)

### STEP 6: ANALYZE COMPLEXITIES & IDENTIFY INEFFICIENCIES

### FINAL: IMPROVISE THE SOLUTION
