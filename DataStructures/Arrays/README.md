# Arrays 

## Definition

- Array is a Datastructure used to store multiple elements of similar type. 
- The memory is allocated in a contiguous order.
- The Index typically starts from 0

## Example

```
arr = ["Apple", "Banana", "Kiwi", "Mango", "Watermelon"]
```

This is an example of an 1D array with 5 elements. The first element will have an index of 0 i.e `Apple`


To create a 2D array

```
arr = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]
    ]
```
