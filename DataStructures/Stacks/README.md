# Stacks

## Definition 

- Datastructure that holds many elements onn on top of each other.
- Follows Last in First out (LIFO) for organizing the elements
- Well, the most popular example the coding community has decided is the use of pancakes ðŸ˜› or the stack of plates. that places one pancake on top of each other or plates.
- The pointer or index variable always points to the latest element.

## Operations

- <b>Push: </b> Add new element
- <b>Pop: </b> Removes the top element
- <b>Peek: </b> Return the top most element
- <b>isEmpty: </b> Check if the stack is empty
- <b>Size </b> Find the numbe rof elements in a stack

## Implementation

- There is a basic class implementation of Stacks with the file name `basic_python.py`. 
- Languages like python already have stacks implemented and we dont have to but its a good idea to follow the same pattern. This will also help it easier to implement in other languages and only the functionality within the class methods will change. This way we will also be following the same terminology.
